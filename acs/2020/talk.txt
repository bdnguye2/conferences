Welcome everyone! My name is Brian Nguyen and I am a 5th year
graduate student from the Furche Group. Today, I will be
presenting on the ``Divergence of Many--Body Perturbation Theory
for Dispersion Interactions.'' Noncovalent interactions have
been traditionally considered ``weak'' relative to the covalent
bond. These interactions are at least an order of magnitude weaker
than covalent bonds. And so, the assumption that the ``weak'' closed--shell
interactions between distant electrons validates the use of the
many--body perturbation theory (MBPT). This is the method to
predict the behaviors of nonvoalent interactions However, recent
reports have shown that the Second-rder Moller--Plesset MBPT (MP2)
yielded large errors in NIs. The question becomes why is many-body
perturbation theory performing poorly? I tackled this question by presenting
both numerical and theoretical results. I reevaluate the performance
of MP2 with the S30L test set and compare it to the Random
Phase Approximation. To analyze these results, I developed the
asymptotic adiabatic connection symmetry-adapted perturbation
theory (AC-SAPT). In the end, I will offer a physical interpretation
and provide recommendations to predict these noncovalent interactions.
Thank you for your attention and I hope to meet with you.

With the S30L test set, the performance of MP2 is revaluated and
compared to the Random Phase Approximation. The test set contains
complexes that are important in molecular biology and supramolecular
chemistry. Systems range from 72 to 204 atoms. These were grouped into
nonpolar interactions, $\pi-\pi$ stacking, halogen bonding, and hydrgeon
bonding. Along with these calculations, I developed asymptotic
adiabatic connection symmetry--adapted perturbation theory (AC-SAPT)
to explain this error and offer a physical interpretation of NIs.

There are attractive properties of RPA to predict NIs. RPA is a non-perturbative
method, naturally includes all possible electronic interactions, contains
no empirical parameters, and is computationally affordable for 100s of
atoms.

All calculations were performed on TURBOMOLE V7.4. RPA total energies
are computed in a post Kohn--Shame fashion by converging KS orbitals
based on a semilocal density functional approximation. I treated the
KS determinant with def2-QZVP basis set while the RPA correlation
computed using Dunning's basis within the forzen core approximation and
50% counterpoise correction.

Looking at Fig. 2, MP2 errors are significant and large for $\pi-\pi$
stacking complexes 1-12 with absolute average error of 34.7 kcal/mol.
MP2 has been reported to be accurate within chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for
hydrogen bond systems based on the smaller molecules. However, for hydrogen
bonding complexes 17 - 22, MP2 absolute average error is 5.45 kcal/mol.
Different flavors of MP2 inherit the same shortcomings of MP2 to a significant
degree. In comparison, RPA absolute average errors for $\pi-\pi$ stacking
and hydrogen bonding complexes are 2.56 kcal/mol and 1.14 kcal/mol, respectively.
RPA performs as accurate as the dispersion corrected PBE functional.
Including the S66 and L7 test sets in Fig. 3, the MP2 binding energy errors
grow 0.1% per valence electron while RPA errors remain fairly flat.

Following these results, we derive the asymptotically exact expressions
for the dispersion energy at large separation, see Eqns. 1) - 5). The
Hamiltonian of the supersystem relies on the SAPT partitioning. We can
imagine the system as a molecular supersystem AB at coupling strength
$\alpha$. Ha and Hb is the Hamiltonian of the isolated subsystems, Vee
is the operator of the electron--electron Coulomb interaction between
A and B, and Vs representsa a local one-electron potential, which
constrains the density of the supersystem groupd state to the physical
ground state density. Using the Hellman--Feynman theorem, we can derive
the interaction energy and the corresponding dispersion energy see Eqn. 4).
This is our cenrtal theoretical result that include the screening of
the bare coulomb interaction and the exchange and correlation effects.
\kappa is the generalized screening function and performing geometric
series expansion imples that the series converges when the eigenvalues
are less than 1. In fig. 4, numerical analysis of this MBPT series
show that it diverges for all molecules except for the least polarizable.

A diagrammatic representation of this can be seen in fig. 5. RPA contains
both intra- and intermonomer screening while MP2 contains no screening leading
to divergence. MP2C slowly converges due to intramonomer screening effect.
With both computational and theoretical results, it is no longer valid
to view these interactions as weak and demonstrates the importance of
this electrodynamic screening as seen in fig 6. It is safe to say that
MBPT can be replaced with RPA for all calculations of NIs.
