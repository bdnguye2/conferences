Dispersion Size-Consistency within the Adiabatic Connection Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory

Noncovalent interactions (NIs) play an important role in molecular biology,
supramolecular chemistry, materials, and molecular crystals. The
characterization and interpretation of NIs have remained a great challenge for
experimentalists and theorists. In a previous work, Nguyen and coworkers
[Nguyen, B. D. et al J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16 (4), 2258â€“2273.]
developed the adiabatic connection symmetry-adapted perturbation theory
(AC-SAPT) for nondegenerate dimers and established the importance of electrodynamic
screening to understand NIs. The AC-SAPT series within the many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) spuriously diverges while AC-SAPT series within random phase approximation
is always convergent. As follow-up to the previous work, I present an extension of the AC-SAPT
formalism within dimers to N-monomers and establish the dispersion size-consistency
condition which states that the total dispersion energy of a N-monomer system
is independent of any partitioning into subsystem. The development of dipsersion
size-consistency provides an additional condition to the Casimir-Polder size-consistency,
which is evident in long-range dispersion interactions. Next, I explore the
disperion theories such as RPA, MBPT, and SAPT that satisfy this condition. Finally,
dispersion energy calculations for RPA and MBPT are shown along with conclusions for
electronic structure theory of NIs and future directions of modeling NIs.
