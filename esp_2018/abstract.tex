\begin{Abstract}

For years, quantum chemical approaches have aimed to accurately and
efficiently predict noncovalent interactions (NIs) between atoms
and molecules. These include dispersion interactions, $\pi$-$\pi$
stacking, or hydrogen and halogen bonding that play an important
role in structural biology and supramolecular chemistry. Here we
assess the performance of the random phase approximation (RPA),
which has evolved from a semi-analytical technique for model
Hamiltonians to a powerful tool for ab initio electronic structure
calculations in chemistry and materials science. The accuracy of
RPA for weakly interacting systems from the L7, S66, and S30L benchmarks
illustrates the critical importance of beyond the pairwise additivity of
NIs in moderately large sized molecules with 100 - 200 atoms. Comparison
to the second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and
semilocal density functional approximations (DFAs) with dispersion
correction reveals that RPA performs better than MP2 and on par with
dispersion corrected-DFAs.
